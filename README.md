# Yuxuan-Ye_5001_Final-Project-Text-advanture

**Introduction**

main_game.py is the main program file, while the text_game.py contains detailed functions. Please run the main_game.py to play the game.




**Final Retrospective/Reflection**

Reflecting on the project, I have come to realize the main learning points I gained from this experience. Firstly, I learned how to write a complete program from scratch, which was a very valuable skill. This gave me an opportunity to understand the entire programming process, from defining variables to debugging and testing. Additionally, I was able to learn how to use class methods in a large program, which was essential in improving the game.

Another important skill I learned was how to use the ast method to load files directly into dictionaries. This was a valuable discovery, as it allowed me to simplify the process of accessing data, reducing the amount of code I had to write.

What I liked about this project was the endless possibilities it offered, being a text-adventure game. The game allowed me to put in a lot of creative ideas, making the process enjoyable and engaging.

However, one major struggle I encountered was when I tried to improve the game. I ended up building a mess of functions nested within functions, which made the game more complicated than it needed to be. In the future, I will need to focus on organizing my code logically and making it easier to read and understand.
